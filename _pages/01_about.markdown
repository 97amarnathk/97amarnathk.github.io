## About this blog

In my blog I plan to write all things I find useful or interesting (mostly related to computers). 

I hope you find something you like here. :slightly_smiling_face:

This blog is built using the following :

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) : A popular static site generator.
* [Primer CSS](https://primer.style) : A minimal, no frills CSS library by Github.
* [OpenPeeps](https://www.openpeeps.com) : A really cool customisable illustration library which I wish I could draw.

A lot of the styles have been inspired from the following blogs :

* [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/)
* [Github Blog](https://github.blog/)
